# spoopy-python
This is my spiritual reincarnation of spoopy-link created by dev-snek

This was created as the original wasn't update and wasn't online much if at all over a 2 year period.
Thus, I decided to recreate it in Python due to wanting a small project and not fully understanding what they had done originally.
